# Projects

## Team Picton – Web App for Student Form Submissions and Approvals
- Developed as a full‑stack web application that streamlines the process of managing student submissions, this project combines the power of Django for a secure backend with the modern interactivity of React on the frontend. Office365 authentication and PostgreSQL are integrated to ensure data integrity and secure access. The application features a multi‑step, role‑based approval workflow with custom Django models and REST endpoints, allowing staff and administrators to review, approve, or return submissions efficiently. An interactive staff dashboard provides real‑time updates and notifications, while reproducible development environments are maintained using tools like Git and micromamba.

## Stock Market Prediction ML Model
- This machine learning project centers on predicting stock price trends using an LSTM-based model developed in PyTorch. The model is built upon a modular codebase that emphasizes collaborative development through Git, along with robust data preprocessing techniques and unit testing to ensure consistency and maintainability. The final predictive performance is illustrated using visualized metrics such as training loss and R-squared values, providing actionable insights into the accuracy of the forecasts.

## Measure Delay Tool for Network Diagnostics
- A practical tool for real‑time network analysis, this Python-based command‑line utility measures performance by differentiating between baseline connectivity and server processing delays. Initially, the tool captures the ICMP ping time to a target server and then issues an HTTP POST request to a specific endpoint. By subtracting the ping time from the overall HTTP response time, it isolates the server’s processing delay. It supports both a standard mode for succinct reporting and a debug mode that logs detailed timing information for each sample. This application is ideal for diagnosing network latency issues and demonstrates your skills in networking, system-level programming, and performance analysis.

## Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Finder with Custom Argument Parsing and Automated Testing
- This project implements Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest paths in weighted directed graphs. The solution reads graph input from files into an adjacency matrix and computes the minimum distances from each vertex to all others. A custom ArgumentManager class enables flexible command‑line input processing, letting users specify input, output, and other parameters with ease. An accompanying shell script automates the build, execution, and comparison of output for multiple test cases, ensuring a high level of reliability and maintainability.

## Custom Word Pattern Matcher with Dictionary Lookup
- This project is a specialized text processing solution that matches tree structure patterns against words in a dictionary. Using C++, it first parses structured input lines to extract tree definitions and valid letter-pair relationships into an efficiently searchable unordered map—with a custom hash function for compound keys. It then reads a dictionary file and evaluates each candidate word against the predefined letter relationships. If a word fully matches the pattern, it is output; otherwise, the system indicates that no matching words were found. 

## Autonomous Vehicle Functional and Non‑Functional Testing Suite
- I developed a comprehensive testing framework in Python to evaluate both the functional and non‑functional requirements of an autonomous vehicle system. My tests cover everything from environmental perception (sensor fusion and obstacle detection) and localization to trajectory planning and vehicle control. Additionally, I integrated tests for system safety, performance metrics (like response times and signal smoothness), and regulatory compliance.
