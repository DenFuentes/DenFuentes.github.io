## Stock Market Prediction ML Model
This machine learning project centers on predicting stock price trends using an LSTM-based model developed in PyTorch. The model is built upon a modular codebase that emphasizes collaborative development through Git, along with robust data preprocessing techniques and unit testing to ensure consistency and maintainability. The final predictive performance is illustrated using visualized metrics such as training loss and R-squared values, providing actionable insights into the accuracy of the forecasts.
