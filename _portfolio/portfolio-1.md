## Team Picton – Web App for Student Form Submissions and Approvals
Developed as a full‑stack web application that streamlines the process of managing student submissions, this project combines the power of Django for a secure backend with the modern interactivity of React on the frontend. Office365 authentication and PostgreSQL are integrated to ensure data integrity and secure access. The application features a multi‑step, role‑based approval workflow with custom Django models and REST endpoints, allowing staff and administrators to review, approve, or return submissions efficiently. An interactive staff dashboard provides real‑time updates and notifications, while reproducible development environments are maintained using tools like Git and micromamba.
